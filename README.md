## My Intro:
This is a current collection of some of my work from my Computer Science program. 
I am currently a Firefighter that is trying to transition out of Emergency Services
and into a different type of role. The following is a self-reflection of my work 
throughout the program with provided links above. 
      
## Self-Reflection:
When I first began this program, I was very nervous as to what it would take from me and if 
I could even get through the material. There were many stressful days and nights that left me 
second-guessing my work if it was satisfactory enough or if I could finish the work on time. 
The Computer Science program has really opened my eyes as to what goes into the development of an application. 
There are so many moving parts and specific details that go into the design and development that I 
had never given any thought to until this program. While the program did feel overwhelming at times, 
I have come away with a better core understanding of the principles and building blocks of Computer Science.

There are still several areas where I need training, practice, and experience, but the following artifacts showcase my strengths 
and interests in this field of study. I have included several artifacts from course work throughout the program that showcase 
key areas. While the required artifacts feature software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases, 
there are several other aspects that are just as important. I noticed the collaboration environment is something entirely 
different than what I was usually accustomed to. The way its distributed amongst sites such as GitHub and not directly 
face-to-face was a new experience for me. Then there was security in which I noticed this is no longer an afterthought and 
how every program and almost every element needs to have some type of secure structure in place. This is just the way of the 
future and the evolution of technology that security will have to become more advance and involved to protect these networks. 
I may have a mindset for this field as my thought process has always been comprised of being aware of my surroundings and if 
there are any imminent dangers due to my current profession. 

The following artifacts showcase what I believe are some of the stronger areas throughout my studies. The first enhancement 
is from my Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course and features several flowcharts about the application design and was 
something I was interested in. The second enhancement consists of a weather station application using a Raspberry Pi. I enjoyed 
the hands-on development of this project and course material and is the reason for my inclusion in this portfolio. My third 
enhancement features patterns and trends from a data mining course. I included this artifact because this was one area, I 
really wanted to learn more about and how to utilize this data because I really enjoy organizing and arranging different elements.
